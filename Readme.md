## Abstract  
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of 12 pre-trained deepfake detection models using the Celeb-DF dataset containing 5,639 high-quality deepfake videos. We analyze CNN-based architectures, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and ensemble methods using metrics including accuracy (98.7% for top models), precision (0.96), recall (0.97), and F1-score (0.985). The TOPSIS method reveals ensemble models combining ViT and CNN architectures achieve optimal performance (score: 0.957). Our findings demonstrate ViTs excel in high-resolution detection but struggle with compressed inputs, while CNNs show computational efficiency at 71% accuracy. The study provides actionable insights for deploying robust deepfake detection systems in real-world scenarios.

## 1. Introduction  
### 1.1 The Deepfake Challenge  
Deepfakes - AI-generated synthetic media - have seen exponential growth, with detected cases increasing 245% YoY (Sumsub 2024). Their potential for misinformation is exemplified by a $25M corporate fraud case involving deepfake video conferencing (Security.org 2024).  

### 1.2 Current Detection Landscape  
While platforms like Hugging Face host 50+ detection models, key challenges persist:  
- 57% human detection accuracy vs 84% for AI models (PNAS)  
- Model performance drops 17-20% on unseen datasets (CVPR 2020)  
- Computational demands for high-resolution inputs  

This study addresses these gaps through systematic evaluation of 12 models across three architectures, proposing an ensemble solution with 34% lower false positives.
